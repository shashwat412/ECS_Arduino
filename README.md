# ECS_Arduino

An Arduino Uno based project where we used a GSM module along with a heartbeat sensor and developed a program to check if it is within the acceptable range. If the range is not met then it sends an SMS alert to the emergency contact.
Presented the project in college engineering clinics and received an S grade for the same.
